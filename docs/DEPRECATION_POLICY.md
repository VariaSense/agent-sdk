# Deprecation Policy

## Principles
- Deprecations are announced at least one minor version before removal.
- Deprecated endpoints remain functional for one minor release.
- Removal occurs only on major releases.

## Process
1. Add deprecation warnings to logs and docs.
2. Provide migration steps in release notes.
3. Remove deprecated APIs in the next major release.

## Communication
- Release notes highlight deprecated features.
- Upgrade checklist includes required changes.
